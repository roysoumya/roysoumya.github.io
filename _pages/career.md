After submitting my Ph.D thesis, I joined as a Ph.D intern at the Health Innovation and Technology Centre of GE Healthcare (Bangalore, India) where I developed generative AI-based patient data models of oncology patients using cutting-edge technologies like vector databases and Langchain, to help clinicians easily navigate patient notes. 

I delivered a tutorial â€œBuilding Trustworthy AI Models for Medicine: From Theory to Applications" ([tutorial website](https://sites.google.com/view/trustworthy-medical-ai/)) at the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining ([WSDM 2025](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2025/tutorials/)), a top-tier Al conference held at Germany in March 2025. 

I have spent 2.5 years at the [Leibniz AI Future Lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/), [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/) in Germany, working with [Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl](http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/). Here, I developed a decision-tree based robust patient subtyping technique for Parkinson's Disease using clinical data, in collaboration with the Hannover Medical School. Here, I also worked of developing efficient pretraining of DNA foundation models like DNABERT.

I completed my MS (Research) degree from IIT Kharagpur in 2019. Here, I developed text classification and sentence-level recommendation solutions that assist reputation management experts in managing brand content on corporate websites. 

During my B.Tech from Kalyani Govt. Engineering College, West Bengal, I also secured the [Indian Academic of Sciences](https://www.ias.ac.in/) Summer Research Fellowship, and spent three months summer internship at IIT Kharagpur. I also co-founded the college programming club, [KeyGEnCoders](https://kgec-coding.github.io/KeyGEnCoders/) in March 2015, which is still actively running in 2025.
