I am an Institute Ph.D. Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, supervised by [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) and [Prof. Shamik Sural](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~shamik/). Currently, I am part of the [Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG)](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) at IIT Kharagpur. 

**Research Interests:** I am passionate about interdisciplinary research related to medical NLP, fast pretraining of gene transformer models and adapting LLMs for medical question-answering and summarization, particularly in limited data settings. 

**Research Experience:** I have spent 2.5 years (January 2021 - July 2023) working as a Research Associate at the [Leibniz AI Future Lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/), [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/) in Germany, with [Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl](http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/). In collaboration with the Hannover Medical School, Germany, I have developed a novel machine-learning methodology for identifying novel patient subtypes for Parkinson's disease. Before joining Ph.D., I have completed an M.S Research degree at CSE Dept. at IIT Kharagpur and worked as a Junior Research Fellow (first 2 years) and Senior Research Fellow. During my bachelors, I also secured the Indian Academic of Sciences Summer Research Fellowship, and spent three months summer internship at IIT Kharagpur.
