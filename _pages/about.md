I successfully defended my Ph.D on May 2025 in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, supervised by [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) and [Prof. Shamik Sural](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~shamik/). My Ph.D thesis title was "Domain Adaptation for Medical Language Understanding". 

**Research Interests:** I have expertise in developing foundational models for medical applications, ranging from NLP (text) models to DNA and sc-RNA-based biological foundational models. For NLP, I work on develop efficient domain adaptation techniques for adapting open-domain generative AI model for medical tasks. Specifically, optimizing the model vocabulary during finetuning (vocabulary adaptation).

**Research Experience:** After submitting my Ph.D, I was a Ph.D intern at the Health Innovation and Technology Centre of GE Healthcare India where I worked on generative AI for oncology use case and developed an embedding model from error codes/system logs of medical devices. I am looking for research scientist and postdoc positions in Foundation Models and Generative AI for medicine. During my Ph.D, I was part of the [Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG)](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) at IIT Kharagpur. I have spent 2.5 years (January 2021 - July 2023) working as a Research Associate at the [Leibniz AI Future Lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/), [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/) in Germany, with [Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl](http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/). In collaboration with the Hannover Medical School, Germany, I have developed a novel machine-learning methodology for identifying novel patient subtypes for Parkinson's disease. Before joining Ph.D., I have completed an M.S Research degree at CSE Dept. at IIT Kharagpur and worked as a Junior Research Fellow (first 2 years) and Senior Research Fellow. During my bachelors, I also secured the Indian Academic of Sciences Summer Research Fellowship, and spent three months summer internship at IIT Kharagpur.
