I am an Institute Ph.D. Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, supervised by [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) and [Prof. Shamik Sural](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~shamik/). I am working on cutting-edge artificial intelligence research with applications to precision medicine. My research interests include medical NLP, gene transformers, and language model pretraining for medicine.

Currently, I am part of the [Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG)](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) at IIT Kharagpur. I have spent 2.5 years (January 2021 - July 2023) working as a Research Associate at the [Leibniz AI Future Lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/), [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/) in Germany, with [Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl](http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/). In collaboration with the Hannover Medical School, Germany, I have developed a novel machine-learning methodology for identifying novel patient subtypes for Parkinson's disease, aiming to develop personalized treatment regimens that are more effective. Before joining Ph.D., I have completed an M.S Research degree at CSE Dept. at IIT Kharagpur and my B.Tech degree at [Kalyani Government Engineering College](https://kgec.edu.in/), West Bengal India.
