I am an incoming postdoctoral scholar of the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Stanford University. 

My primary area of research is natural language processing, with expertise in medical and healthcare applications. My research areas of interest are Foundation Models for Medicine, Generative AI, Text Summarization, and Efficient Pretraining. 

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where I worked with  [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) and [Prof. Shamik Sural](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~shamik/). Here, I was part of the [Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG)](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/). 

My PhD thesis is titled "Domain Adaptation for Medical Language Understanding", where I developed novel domain adaptation techniques to effectively and efficiently adapt open-domain AI models to the medical domain. 

Please go through my [CV](https://roysoumya.github.io/assets/pdf/own_cv.pdf) for further details.
