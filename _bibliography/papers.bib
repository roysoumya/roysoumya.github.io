abstract = {Online medical forums have become a predominant platform for answering health-related information needs of consumers. However, with a significant rise in the number of queries and the limited availability of experts, it is necessary to automatically classify medical queries based on a consumer's intention, so that these questions may be directed to the right set of medical experts. Here, we develop a novel medical knowledge-aware BERT-based model (MedBERT) that explicitly gives more weightage to medical concept-bearing words, and utilize domain-specific side information obtained from a popular medical knowledge base. We also contribute a multi-label dataset for the Medical Forum Question Classification (MFQC) task. MedBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets and performs very well in low resource settings.},

abstract = {A consumer-dependent (business-to-consumer) organization tends to present itself as possessing a set of human qualities, which is termed the brand personality of the company. The perception is impressed upon the consumer through the content, be it in the form of advertisement, blogs, or magazines, produced by the organization. A consistent brand will generate trust and retain customers over time as they develop an affinity toward regularity and common patterns. However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content that needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles that are not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making a web article more consistent with the company’s brand personality.},

abstract = {Brands produce content to engage with the audience continually and tend to maintain a set of human characteristics in their marketing campaigns. In this era of digital marketing, they need to create a lot of content to keep up the engagement with their audiences. However, such kind of content authoring at scale introduces challenges in maintaining consistency in a brand's messaging tone, which is very important from a brand's perspective to ensure a persistent impression for its customers and audiences. In this work, we quantify brand personality and formulate its linguistic features. We score text articles extracted from brand communications on five personality dimensions: sincerity, excitement, competence, ruggedness and sophistication, and show that a linear SVM model achieves a decent F1 score of $0.822$. The linear SVM allows us to annotate a large set of data points free of any annotation error. We utilize this huge annotated dataset to characterize the notion of brand consistency, which is maintaining a company's targeted brand personality across time and over different content categories; we make certain interesting observations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates brand personality from the company's official websites, and that formulates and analyzes the notion of brand consistency on such a large scale.},

abstract="Clinical Trials are crucial for the practice of evidence-based medicine. It provides updated and essential health-related information for the patients. Sometimes, Clinical trials are the first source of information about new drugs and treatments. Different stakeholders, such as trial volunteers, trial investigators, and meta-analyses researchers often need to search for trials. In this paper, we propose an automated method to retrieve relevant trials based on the overlap of UMLS concepts between the user query and clinical trials. However, different stakeholders may have different information needs, and accordingly, we rank the retrieved clinical trials based on the following four aspects -- Relevancy, Adversity, Recency, and Popularity. We aim to develop a clinical trial search system which covers multiple disease classes, instead of only focusing on retrieval of oncology-based clinical trials. We follow a rigorous annotation scheme and create an annotated retrieval set for 25 queries, across five disease categories. Our proposed method performs better than the baseline model in almost {\$}{\$}90{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$} cases. We also measure the correlation between the different aspect-based ranking lists and observe a high negative Spearman rank's correlation coefficient between popularity and recency.",

abstract="Email is important for task and project management, information exchange, scheduling, and also for social communication among users. Understanding the pattern of interaction in between the email and the recipients as well as the factors which are responsible for determining user replying behavior help in addressing the problem of email overload, which users face due to the increasing volume of email traffic. In this paper, we develop a binary classification model to predict an email recipient response, based on certain email metadata and recipient email usage characteristics. For this task, we study a 2016 HackerRank contest email dataset. We first identify email interactivity patterns separately for each recipient response and then understand the factors responsible for determining the user response to an email. We then propose a novel feature selection methodology where we perform dataset profiling based on user and sent day characteristics, using k-means clustering. We observe that the Decision Tree classifier performs the best with a F1 score of 0.6279 and the fraction of emails opened by the recipient in the past being the most significant feature for the model.",
